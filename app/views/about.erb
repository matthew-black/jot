      Jot combines one minute of mindful breathing with five minutes of freewriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a daily relaxation ritual. Jot is less about the output and more about how you'll feel after the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's meant to be beautiful and simple, a little space where you can come to feel calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel comfortable to save what you create. Jot isn't about sharing, so anything you write will be defaulted to private.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an abbreviated version of what the process looks like.

    <p>
      I hope you'll give it a try.
    </p>

      Cheers,
