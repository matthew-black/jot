## To-Dos:
  1. Homepage should be a pretty view of recent public jots.
  2. Upon login, the homepage stays the same, but the nav bar includes a username link and a 'jot' link.
  3. Username link goes to a show page of all the user's jots.
    * users cannot edit jots, but can choose which to make private/public
  4. Jot link goes to jots/new -- remember to follow unsplash guidelines!
    * show an unsplash photo for 60 seconds
    * display textarea below the photo for five minutes
    * display submit button to create the jot
