# jot
Jot is a minimalistic writing prompt web app that I made to help myself get back into
writing as a creative outlet. It takes about six minutes to write a new jot.
One minute to look at the picture and follow along with a yoga-based breathing exercise, then five minutes to write something.

## Things to Add
* A not-logged-in user should be able to demo the app.
* Refine the API interaction to present photos that represent more cultural and geographic diversity.
* Add pagination to a user's page. 25 jots displayed vertically would not be good...
* Port to Rails in order to use Devise (or Sorcery) and Kaminari?
* Maybe make a short little video of what the process looks like? (Maybe with some snazzy uke playin' in the background?)
* Quick bug fix: Don't save photo info to the database unless it's associated with a jot.
